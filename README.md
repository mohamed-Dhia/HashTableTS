## _what is this_

### an implementation of a hash table using TypeScript

## _why_

### well...why not ? I just felt bored so why not play around with TypeScript (especially generics) and once I was done with the bare minimum I started testing with jest

## _what did I use_

* ### [**TypeScript**](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) 🥰

* ### [**jest**](https://github.com/facebook/jest) 🧪

* ### [**eslint**](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) 🔍 with [**prettier**](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) 🎀 to enforce some rules 😤 🏫

* ### [**yarn**](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) 🐾 my preffered package manager
